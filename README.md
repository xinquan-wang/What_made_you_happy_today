# What made you happy today?
+ This project is conducted by [Xinquan Wang]

+ Project summary: What made your day? Happiness comes and goes, and sometimes no one including ourselves don't know about it. In this project, I want to explore the causes that can make people happy. Thus based on the corpus of HappyDB which is “a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments”, I carried out an exploratory data analysis using text mining and sentiment analysis. Also, I built five machine learning models to classify happy moments into different category.
