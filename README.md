### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: What made you happy today?
+ This project is conducted by [Xinquan Wang]

+ Project summary: What made your day? Happiness comes and goes, and sometimes no one including ourselves don't know about it. In this project, I want to explore the causes that can make people happy. Thus based on the corpus of HappyDB which is “a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments”, I carried out an exploratory data analysis using text mining and sentiment analysis. Baisically, frequency analysis and sentiment analysis were used alternately to analyse some characteristics of happy moment categories, the influence of gender and marital status on the focus of happy moment. 
The results demontrated that 
1. *affection* and *achievement* are top 2 reasons which lead to happiness but people tend to hold relatively less positive attitude towards them. Interestingly, though less mentioned, *bonding* and *leisure* receive most positive perspectives. 
2. Gender has something to do with the happy moments. Males present more trust word in the happy moments and enjoy job as well as playful moments. While females show more joy when conveying happy moments and tend to take pleasure in special events and daily life activities.
3. Marital status also has influence on the happy moments. Single people favor individual and external relationships. Remarkably, divorced and separated, married and widowed demonstrate high similarity within groups, suggesting people in these two groups may share similar life experience and lifestyle.
